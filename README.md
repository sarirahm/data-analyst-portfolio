# Data Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of queries that I use to explore and analyze data. It serves as a personal library where I document my learning journey and showcase different analytical approaches.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my hands-on experience with query, highlight insights drawn from real-world datasets, and continuously improve through feedback.

Iâ€™m always open to suggestions, ideas, or collaboration. Feel free to explore, review, and share your thoughts!
